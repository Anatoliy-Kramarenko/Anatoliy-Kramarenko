I got bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering in 2015 and has since been working for software companies of all sizes from all around the globe as a freelancer. Currently, 

Languages and technologies:

- Languages: Python, ES6, JavaScript, C#, HTML/CSS, Bootstrap

- Frameworks: Django, React / Redux Express, Node.js, Vue.js / Vux

- Databases: MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB, AWS DynamoDB

- Other Technologies & Tools: Git, RESTful APIs, GraphQL

I'm open to learning new frameworks or languages that are needed to fulfil a project.

I start with understanding and documenting the client's requirements. I use mock-ups and wireframes to design the UI based on the user experience desired. I evaluate appropriate platforms, tools, and languages to offer the best results at the lowest cost and fastest delivery. I am very conscious about making sure we stay within budget and deliver on time so that you will get timely updates and demos of the progress of the project.

Skills:  Python | Vue.js | React.js | PHP|
